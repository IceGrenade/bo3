	Difficulty to Implement = 4 (This code snippet is not for beginners, some prior knowledge is assumed)[0=Easy-10=Advanced]
	
	Details
			This is a script that implements a trigger that can ONLY BE SHOT BY ONE WEAPON
			The weapon can be changed to whatever you want it to be (look in zm_levelcommon_weapons.csv for weapon names)

	Instructions:
			1. Change the "pistol_standard" in the weapon_to_shoot_with variable to whatever gun you want it to be shot with
			(default MR6)
			2. Add a model/ brushmodel in the map with the targetname shootable_1weap_model
			3. Add a trigger_damage, over the model/ brushmodel, with the targetname shootable_1weap_trig
			Note: trigger MUST be trigger_damage otherwise it will not work properly!
				  a. It's also worth ticking EXPLOSION_NO on the trigger_damage so it isn't set off by grenades, this will stop all
				  explosive weapons though so you can decide if you want it on or not
				  b. If you have any problems/ questions message me on Discord xReaction#7551 or twitter @SFLReaction
