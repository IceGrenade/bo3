//To use this script you must provide credit to the Authors on your Workshop page of the map you use this in
//Authors: IceGrenade

//Difficulty to Implement = 4/10 (This code snippet is not for beginners, some prior knowledge is assumed)
//[0=Easy-10=Advanced]

//Requires the following functions:
//https://github.com/IceGrenade/bo3/blob/master/scripts/screen_text.gsc

//Details
// This script rewards players with all perks and points.
// You can set it to give different rewards and messages with the variables.

//Instructions:
// 1. Modify the Message content
//       Use ^1 to change the colour of the text to red
//       Colour codes: ^1 red, ^2 green, ^3 yellow, ^4 blue, ^5 light blue, ^6 = purple, ^7 = white, ^8 Dark Blue, ^9 = grey, ^0 = black
// 2. Add a trigger in the map where this reward can be activated or comment out all 'gaperk' lines to have it reward instantly when called with thread iceGrenade_AllPerks();
// 3. Lines 28-38 Set whatever variables you like. Messages / trigger text / reward type / amount / sound

//Place this at the bottom of your Main() function before the closing bracket (})
thread iceGrenade_AllPerks();

//Place this at the bottom of your mapname.gsc
