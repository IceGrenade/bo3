	Difficulty to Implement = 4 (This code snippet is not for beginners, some prior knowledge is assumed)[0=Easy-10=Advanced]

	Requires the following functions: https:github.com/IceGrenade/bo3/blob/master/scripts/screen_text.gsc

	Details
		This script rewards players with all perks and points.
		You can set it to give different rewards and messages with the variables.

	Instructions:
		1. Modify the Message content
	       Use ^1 to change the colour of the text to red
	       Colour codes: ^1 red, ^2 green, ^3 yellow, ^4 blue, ^5 light blue, ^6 = purple, ^7 = white, ^8 Dark Blue, ^9 = grey, ^0 = black
		2. Add a trigger in the map where this reward can be activated or comment out all 'gaperk' lines to have it reward instantly when called with thread iceGrenade_AllPerks();
		3. Lines 28-38 Set whatever variables you like. Messages / trigger text / reward type / amount / sound
