[Edit] There is a new easier fix!
you can fix it by simply moving one line up higher in your map gsc üòÅ

move:
level._zombie_custom_add_weapons =&custom_add_weapons;

above your:
zm_usermap::main();

The Wallbuy 0 Bug is a mischevious one that not many people realise is easy to fix

Solution: Rename the level common weapon file and everywhere where it is referenced.

Details: Take a copy of your usermaps gsc and csc from your share/raw/scripts/zm/ folder
Place them into your usermaps/mapname/scripts/zm/
Put a reference to your usermaps & replace the levelcommon reference with the new file name one:
```csv
stringtable,gamedata/weapons/zm/zm_fallguys_weapons.csv
scriptparsetree,scripts/zm/zm_usermap.gsc
scriptparsetree,scripts/zm/zm_usermap.csc
```
Overall this means update the references in:
```
mapname.gsc
mapname.csc
usermaps.gsc
usermaps.csc
mapname.zone
```
Done!

E.g. I changed mine to zm_fallguys_weapons. Now I will never have broken wallbuys in my maps and players will not need to restart from the 0 purchase bug!
