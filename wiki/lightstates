Q: IceGrenade, how do I setup Lightstates?

A: You can add this code to enable a certain lightstates.
You can setup up to 4 different variations of light setups
(whether you want lights on or off enabled with code, this also will change your sun volume ssi setting)

Add this under where your power turns on. Can also add one with the value 0 in your main function to set it to 0. (0=1, 1=2) so in radiant setting lightstate 1 enabled on a light (means it will be turned on if you set the code lightstate to 0). and 1 =2 vice versa
    level util::set_lighting_state( 1 );

//I have mine setup with a function I call in main usually, put this at the bottom of your mapname.gsc:
    function iceGrenade_PowerLights()
    {
        self endon("death");
        level endon("end_game");

        for(;;)
        {
            level util::set_lighting_state( 0 );
            level flag::wait_till( "power_on" );
            level util::set_lighting_state( 1 );
            level flag::wait_till_clear( "power_on" );
        }
    }   

//then put:
    thread iceGrenade_PowerLights();
//at the bottom of your Main() before it closes }

//^this code means before you turn on power, it will have the lightstate 1 enabled.
//Then when you turn on power it will flip to lightstate 2.
//This is also an option you need to setup on your sun volume.
//Need to give it an ssi 2 set
//You can also setup any number of lights in radiant and enable/disable their lightstate toggle to make them turn on/off as you please.
